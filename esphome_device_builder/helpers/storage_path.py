"""
Canonical StorageJSON / idedata path resolution for the dashboard.

Single source of truth for "given a :attr:`FirmwareJob.configuration`,
where does its :class:`StorageJSON` sidecar / ``idedata.json`` live
on disk?". Every caller in this project that wants to load a sidecar
should route through :func:`resolve_storage_path` (or the lower-level
:func:`resolve_data_dir` when it needs to compose its own subpath)
rather than calling upstream :func:`esphome.storage_json.ext_storage_path`
directly.

Why a project-local helper rather than just using ``ext_storage_path``:

The upstream helper assumes ``CORE.data_dir`` is the right base for
every YAML — which is true for the user's local YAMLs (the dashboard
process sets ``CORE.config_path`` to a sentinel inside ``config_dir``
on startup and ``data_dir`` resolves off that) but **wrong** for the
receiver-side remote-build flow. There the compile subprocess runs
with ``ESPHOME_DATA_DIR`` pinned to a per-dashboard subdirectory of
``CORE.data_dir`` (``<CORE.data_dir>/.remote_builds/<dashboard_id>/.esphome``,
the same path the writer-side env override produces — see
:meth:`FirmwareController._compose_subprocess_env`) so esphome writes
storage / idedata / build under that one ``dashboard_id``-keyed
directory. The dashboard process's own writes still land at the
top level of ``CORE.data_dir`` (``<data_dir>/storage/...``), so a
naive ``ext_storage_path(configuration)`` call against the bare
configuration string resolves to a path the subprocess didn't write
to — silent ``FileNotFoundError`` on every receiver-side
``download_artifacts`` request after a successful compile.

The fork happens once, here, keyed on whether the configuration
parses through :func:`helpers.remote_build_layout.parse_from_configuration`
as a remote-build path. Local-only callers see identical behaviour
to the old direct-``ext_storage_path`` form because the parser returns
``None`` for bare-basename inputs.

Why a separate module rather than co-locating with
:mod:`helpers.build_artifacts`: ``build_artifacts`` is the
flash-image discovery + idedata-manifest loader; the storage-path
resolution is a more general primitive that several unrelated
call sites need (``config_hash`` for the build-info hash,
``build_size`` for compile size accounting, ``devices.helpers``
for delete / archive sweeps, ``firmware.get_binaries`` for the
download endpoint, …). Keeping the helper here means those callers
don't pull the artifacts-loader's transitive dependencies.

    For a receiver-side remote-build job (configuration parses
    as a :class:`RemoteBuildPath`) the compile subprocess runs
    with ``ESPHOME_DATA_DIR`` pinned to a per-dashboard
    subdirectory of ``CORE.data_dir`` (see

    storage / idedata / build_path all land under

    For everything else (a locally-submitted job, an
    offloader-side handle) it falls back to ``CORE.data_dir``
    which honours the existing deployment-mode logic (default /
    HA-addon / ``ESPHOME_DATA_DIR`` env override).

    Anchoring on ``CORE.data_dir`` matters on the HA addon: the
    dashboard's ``data_dir`` there is ``/data`` (the addon's
    per-instance volume), so remote-build artefacts that can
    run to multiple gigabytes land on the volume the operator
    expects to grow rather than on ``/config`` (the user's
    Home Assistant config mount).

    The writer-side env override and this reader-side resolver
    both route the same configuration string through
    :func:`parse_from_configuration` AND anchor on

    * **Receiver-side remote-build configurations**
      (``.esphome/.remote_builds/<dashboard_id>/<device>/<device>.yaml``):
      sidecar lives at

    Centralised so the writer-side env override (pinned in

    :func:`esphome.storage_json.storage_path` keys on

    its sidecar at
